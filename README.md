## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.7+
- PyQt5 Library
- Conda or Virtualenv (Optional but recommended)

### Setting Up the Environment

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pyqt5-projects.git
   cd pyqt5-projects
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   Using Conda:
   ```bash
   conda create --name pyqt5_env python=3.8
   conda activate pyqt5_env
   ```

   Using Virtualenv:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install PyQt5 (if not included in `requirements.txt`):

   ```bash
   pip install PyQt5
   ```

## Projects Overview

### Click Counter

A simple, interactive application that counts button clicks. The application demonstrates basic PyQt5 concepts like event handling, label updates, and styling.

#### Features:
- Incremental counter displayed in a circular label.
- Dynamic button click response.

#### Usage:
1. Run the `click_counter.py` file:

   ```bash
   python click_counter.py
   ```
2. Click the button to increment the counter.

### Calculator

A basic calculator for performing arithmetic operations. This project demonstrates button handling and dynamic label updates in PyQt5.

#### Features:
- Basic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
- Reset and backspace functionality.
- Error handling for invalid inputs.

#### Usage:
1. Run the `calculator.py` file:

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```
2. Use the buttons for arithmetic operations.

### Advanced Calculator

A full-featured scientific calculator that includes basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithmic calculations, and memory storage.

#### Features:
- Basic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
- Advanced operations: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `log`, `ln`, `xÂ²`, `âˆš`, etc.
- Memory functions: `M+`, `M-`, `MR`.
- Switch between Degree and Radian mode.
- Intuitive GUI with hover effects.

#### Usage:
1. Run the `advanced_calculator.py` file:

   ```bash
   python advanced_calculator.py
   ```
2. Explore various functions using the intuitive buttons.

## Setting Up the Environment

### Using Qt Designer for Custom GUIs

1. Design your UI in Qt Designer.
2. Convert the `.ui` file to a Python file using:

   ```bash
   pyuic5 -x file.ui -o file.py
   ```

3. Customize the Python file to add functionalities.

### Folder Structure

```plaintext
pyqt5-projects/
â”œâ”€â”€ click_counter.py         # Click Counter Application
â”œâ”€â”€ calculator.py            # Basic Calculator
â”œâ”€â”€ advanced_calculator.py   # Advanced Scientific Calculator
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt         # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                # Project documentation
â””â”€â”€ ui_designs/              # (Optional) UI files from Qt Designer
```

---

## Running the Projects

1. Navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the desired Python script using:

   ```bash
   python <filename>.py
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   python click_counter.py
   ```

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add **dark mode** to all applications.
- Introduce **keyboard shortcuts** for the calculators.
- Develop additional GUI projects like To-Do List or Expense Tracker.
- Integrate Machine Learning models into PyQt5 GUIs.
